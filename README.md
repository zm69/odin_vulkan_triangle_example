# odin_vulkan_triangle_example
The Vulkan "hello world" (triangle) example is divided into parts for learning purposes.

It was tested on Windows only. It might work on other OSes too.

## How to understand the code

Start from main.odin file. The code there is very simple. It uses the code from the /engine folder. The source code in the /engine folder is divided into parts for easier learning and understanding.
In a real engine, the code organization would be different.

## How to run the code 

1. Go to the shaders folder and run compile.bat (or commands inside it) to compile shaders
```
    compile.bat
```
3. Go back to the main folder and run:
```
    odin run .
```

## Result should be this:
