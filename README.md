# odin_vulkan_triangle_example
The Vulkan hello world (triangle) example is divided into parts for learning purposes.

It was tested on Windows only. Might work on other OSes too.

## How to understand the code

Start from main.odin file. The code there is very simple, it just uses the code from /engine folder. The code there is divided into parts for easier learning and understanding.
In a real engine the code organization will be different.

## How to run the code 

1. Go to shaders folder and run compile.bat (or commands inside it) to compile shaders
2. Go back to main folder and run:  odin run .
